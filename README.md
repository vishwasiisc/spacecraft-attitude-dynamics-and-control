This project illustrates how to evaluate and implement a range of attitude control modes. Besides the
simple PD control uses here, other attitude tracking control solutions could readily be substituted. When
studying the response of such simulations, it is very helpful to create a three-dimensional visualization
where the simulation states are used to illustrate how a spacecraft model is pointing in inertial space.
